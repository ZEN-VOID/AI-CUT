# Theme Factory Skill

## Context Loading Contract

- 每次调用本技能时，必须同时加载同目录 `CONTEXT.md` 作为预加载上下文。
- 若同目录 `CONTEXT.md` 缺失，应先补齐最小知识库骨架，或向用户明确报告阻塞；不得在未检查该上下文的情况下执行技能。
- 冲突优先级：用户显式请求 > 仓库/全局 `AGENTS.md` > 本 `SKILL.md` > 同目录 `CONTEXT.md`。

This skill provides a curated collection of professional font and color themes themes, each with carefully selected color palettes and font pairings. Once a theme is chosen, it can be applied to any artifact.

## Purpose

To apply consistent, professional styling to presentation slide decks, use this skill. Each theme includes:
- A cohesive color palette with hex codes
- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text
- A distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences

## Usage Instructions

To apply styling to a slide deck or other artifact:

1. **Show the theme showcase**: Display the `theme-showcase.pdf` file to allow users to see all available themes visually. Do not make any modifications to it; simply show the file for viewing.
2. **Ask for their choice**: Ask which theme to apply to the deck
3. **Wait for selection**: Get explicit confirmation about the chosen theme
4. **Apply the theme**: Once a theme has been chosen, apply the selected theme's colors and fonts to the deck/artifact

## Themes Available

The following 10 themes are available, each showcased in `theme-showcase.pdf`:

1. **Ocean Depths** - Professional and calming maritime theme
2. **Sunset Boulevard** - Warm and vibrant sunset colors
3. **Forest Canopy** - Natural and grounded earth tones
4. **Modern Minimalist** - Clean and contemporary grayscale
5. **Golden Hour** - Rich and warm autumnal palette
6. **Arctic Frost** - Cool and crisp winter-inspired theme
7. **Desert Rose** - Soft and sophisticated dusty tones
8. **Tech Innovation** - Bold and modern tech aesthetic
9. **Botanical Garden** - Fresh and organic garden colors
10. **Midnight Galaxy** - Dramatic and cosmic deep tones

## Theme Details

Each theme is defined in the `themes/` directory with complete specifications including:
- Cohesive color palette with hex codes
- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text
- Distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences

## Application Process

After a preferred theme is selected:
1. Read the corresponding theme file from the `themes/` directory
2. Apply the specified colors and fonts consistently throughout the deck
3. Ensure proper contrast and readability
4. Maintain the theme's visual identity across all slides

## Create your Own Theme
To handle cases where none of the existing themes work for an artifact, create a custom theme. Based on provided inputs, generate a new theme similar to the ones above. Give the theme a similar name describing what the font/color combinations represent. Use any basic description provided to choose appropriate colors/fonts. After generating the theme, show it for review and verification. Following that, apply the theme as described above.


## Context Preload (Mandatory)

- 每次调用本技能时，必须自动加载同目录 `CONTEXT.md` 作为预加载上下文。
- 冲突优先级固定为：用户显式请求 > AGENT.md / 元规则 > SKILL.md > CONTEXT.md。
- 失败闭环必须回写 `CONTEXT.md`：记录 `root cause location + immediate fix + systemic prevention fix + layered trace path`。
- 成功闭环必须回写 `CONTEXT.md`：沉淀可复用 heuristic，并标注 promotion scope。
- 禁止将 `CONTEXT.md` 当作过程日志；默认采用知识库模式（Type Map / Repair Playbook / Reusable Heuristics）。
